This document intends to shed light on the current development plans of the team.
Plans change constantly as new information is absorbed by the team.

Codebase stewards review the roadmap monthly as part of our [backlog pruning session](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/standard-maintenance/backlog-pruning.html).

## Current work

* Work through the issue backlog
* As far as possible, make the standard Standard-compliant

## Near term

* Separate executive summary
* Clarify "code" as "source code" or "policy code" when specific to one, issue #208
* Possibly: add in the illustrations for each criterion

## Longer term

* Certification badges
* Add to README and index.md information (and eventually statistics) on adoption and use (issue #438)
* Physical paper checklist
* Becoming validated by multiple codebases
* Linkable requirements
* New cover art
* Register for ISBN
* List with an on-demand book printing service
* QR codes for external links in print version
