This document intends to shed light on the current development plans of the community for the Standard for Public Code.
Plans change constantly as new information is absorbed.

The [Steering team](../GOVERNANCE.md#steering-team) and community review the roadmap periodically as part of the regular [community calls](https://github.com/standard-for-public-code/standard-for-public-code/discussions/categories/community-calls) and [releasing a new version](./releasing.md#releasing-a-new-version-of-the-standard-for-public-code).

## Current work

* As far as possible, make the standard Standard-compliant
  * Obtain committed collaborating organizations

## Near term

* Separate executive summary (issue #302)
* Possibly: add in the illustrations for each criterion

## Longer term

* Become an ISO standard, see [notes from a community call](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2023/10/09/notes-from-community-call-5-october-2023.html)
* Add to README and index.md information (and eventually statistics) on adoption and use (issue #438)
* Becoming validated by multiple codebases
* Release version 1.0.0 after a few codebases are compliant, see [notes from a community call](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2022/07/07/notes-from-community-call-7-july-2022.html)
* Linkable requirements
* New cover art
* Register for ISBN
* List with an on-demand book printing service
* QR codes or mobile-friendly external links in print version
* Add possibility to view older versions of the standard on the website, not only under the GitHub releases
* Expert (external) review of accessibility
