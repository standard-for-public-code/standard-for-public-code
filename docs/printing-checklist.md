The printed Standard for Public Code checklist is printed by Reclameland.
This guide tries to provide the relevant information to print it there or somewhere else.

Details, mostly in the order they are on the Reclameland page with the Dutch if necessary:

* Form: Folders ([Reclameland product page](https://www.reclameland.nl/drukken/folders))
* Format: A5
* Folding method: portrait 4-sided (Staand 4-zijdig)
* Printing: 4/4 dual sided full color
* Inside material: 90 grams
* Treatment: none

When these details are chosen, the pdf is uploaded and the order is placed. Payment can then happen (payment ahead) after which printing starts.
