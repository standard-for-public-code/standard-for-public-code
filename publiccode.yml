    longDescription: |
      The Standard for Public Code gives public organizations a model for
      preparing open source solutions to enable collaborations with similar
      public organizations in other places. It includes guidance for policy
      makers, city administrators, developers and vendors.


      We define ‘public code’ as open source software developed by public
      organizations, together with the policy and guidance needed for
      collaboration and reuse.


      The Standard is recognized as a [Digital Public
      Good](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/standard-for-public-code.html)
      by the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/).
