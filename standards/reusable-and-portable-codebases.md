# Create reusable and portable code

## Measure

* The codebase MUST be developed to be reusable in different contexts
* The codebase MUST be independent from any secret, proprietary or non-open licenced code or services for execution and understanding
* Code SHOULD be general purpose and SHOULD be configurable
* Code and its documentation SHOULD not contain situation-specific information. For example, personal and organisational data as well as tokens and passwords should never be included.


## What this does

* Enables other policy makers, developers and designers to reuse what you've developed, to test it, to improve it and contribute those improvements back leading to better quality, cheaper maintainability and higher reliability.
* More general code is easier to understand for new people that have to work with the code.
* Understanding and reflecting on how codebases can be reused makes it easier to control the mission, vision and scope of the codebase.

## What this doesn’t do

* Get others to reuse the codebase
* Build a community

## How to test

Ask someone in a similar role at another organisation if they could reuse your codebase and what that would entail

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Document your policy with enough clarity and detail that it can be understood outside of its original context

## Management: what you need to do

* Make sure that stakeholders and business owners understand that reusability is an explicit goal of the project as it reduces technical debt and provides sustainability for the codebase

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Source should be designed for reuse by other users and organizations
* Source should be designed to solve a general problem instead of a specific one
* Someone in a similar organization facing a similar problem should be able to use your solution
