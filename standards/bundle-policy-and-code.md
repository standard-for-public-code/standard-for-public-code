# Bundle policy and source code

## Measure

* A Codebase MUST include all the policy that source code is based upon
* A Codebase MUST include all source code that the policy is based upon
* All policy and source code that the codebase is based upon MUST be documented, reusable and portable
* Policy SHOULD be provided in machine readable and unambiguous formats
* Continuous Integration tests SHOULD validate the source code and the policy are executed coherently

## What this does

* Make sure that when a Public Organisation re-uses codebases that they are able to do this effectively since they have access to both the source as well as the civic code necessary

## What this doesn’t do

## How to test

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Develop policy with the same version control and documentation mechanisms that are used to develop source code
* Develop Policy in formats that are unambiguous and machine readable such as Business Process Model Notation, Decision Model Notion and Case Management Model Notation
* Try to periodically understand what the non-policy code in the codebase does

## Management: what you need to do

* Involve policy makers and developers and designers and keep them connected all throughout the development process
* Make sure policy makers and developers and designers they are working on the same objectives
