# Publish with an open license

## Requirements

* All code and documentation MUST be published under a license that allows it to be freely reusable, changeable and redistributable
* Software source code MUST be licensed under an [OSI-approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses/category)
* Codebases MAY have multiple licenses for different types of code and documentation
* Documentation MAY be published under [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) that are NOT 'no derivatives' or 'non-commercial'

## Why this is important

* Makes it possible for anyone to see the code and know that they can and how they can reuse it

## What this does not do

* Prevent use of the code by any specific actors

## How to test

* There is at least 1 license file present in the codebase, usually called `license`
* If there is source code in the codebase there is a license present that is on the [OSI-approved Open Source license list](https://opensource.org/licenses/category)

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Develop policy that requires code to be open source
* Develop policy that disincentives non-open source code and technology in procurement

## Management: what you need to do

* Only work with open source vendors that deliver their code by publishing it under an open source license

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Add a new `license` file to every new codebase created
