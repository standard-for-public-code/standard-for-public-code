# Document your code

## Requirements

* All of the functionality of your codebase – policy as well as source – MUST be described in language clearly understandable for those that understand the purpose of the code
* The documentation of your codebase MUST contain:
  * a description of how to install and run the source code
  * examples demonstrating the key functionality
* The documentation of your codebase SHOULD contain:
  * a high level description that is clearly understandable for a wide audience of stakeholders, like the general public and journalists
  * a section describing how to install and run a standalone version of the source code, including, if necessary, a test dataset
  * examples for all functionality
* There SHOULD be continuous integration tests for the quality of your documentation
* The documentation of your codebase MAY contain examples that make users want to immediately start using your codebase
* You MAY use the examples in your documentation to test your code

## Why this is important

* Users can start using and contributing more quickly
* You help people discover your codebase, especially people asking 'is there already code that does something like this'
* This provides transparency into your organization and processes

## What this does not do

* Contribute directly to more reusable, portable code (see [Code in the open](../community-criteria/code-in-the-open.md))

## How to test

* Other stakeholders, professionals from other public organizations and the general public find the documentation clear and understandable
* Documentation is generated from code
* Links and images are automatically tested

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Check in regularly to understand how the non-policy code in the codebase has changed
* Give feedback on how to make non-policy documentation more clear

## Management: what you need to do

* Try to use the codebase
* Make sure you understand both the policy and source code as well as the documentation

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Check in regularly to understand how the non-source code in the codebase has changed
* Give feedback on how to make non-source documentation more clear
