# Welcome contributions

## Requirements

* The codebase MUST have a public issue tracker that accepts suggestions from anyone
* The codebase MUST allow anyone to submit suggestions for changes to the codebase
* The documentation MUST link to both the public issue tracker and submitted codebase changes
* The codebase MUST include an email address for security issues and responsible disclosure
* The codebase MUST include contribution guidelines explaining how contributors can get involved
* The codebase SHOULD have a publicly available roadmap
* The codebase SHOULD advertise the committed engagement of involved organizations in the development and maintenance
* The codebase MAY include a code of conduct for contributors
* The codebase MAY document the governance of the codebase, contributions and its community, for example in a `GOVERNANCE` file

## Why this is important

* Allows collaborative uptake of shared digital infrastructure
* Prevents forks of codebases, in which a community that works on a project splits because there is no shared progress
* Helps users decide to use one codebase over another
* Enables users to fix problems and add features to the shared codebase leading to better, more reliable and feature rich software

## What this does not do

* Guarantee others will reuse the codebase

## How to test

* There's a public issue tracker.
* It's possible to submit suggestions for changes to the codebase.
* There are contribution guidelines.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Add a list to the codebase of any other resources that policy experts, non-governmental organizations and academics would find useful for understanding or reusing your policy
* Track policy issues in the codebase, so that a relevant external policy expert can volunteer help
* Consider adding contact details so that other policy makers considering reuse can ask you for advice

## Management: what you need to do

* Make sure the documentation explains how your organization is involved in the project, what resources it has available for it and for how long
* Track management issues in the codebase, so that external managers with relevant experience can volunteer help.
* Support your experienced policy makers, developers and designers to keep contributing to the codebase for as long as possible.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Respond promptly to requests
