# Use plain English

## Requirements

* All codebase documentation MUST be in English.
* All code MUST be in English, except where policy is machine interpreted as code.
* All bundled policy not available in English MUST have an accompanying summary in English.
* Any translation MUST be up to date with the English version and vice versa.
* There SHOULD be no acronyms, abbreviations, puns or legal/non-English/domain specific terms in the codebase without an explanation preceding it or a link to an explanation.
* The name of the codebase SHOULD be descriptive and free from acronyms, abbreviations, puns or organizational branding.
* Documentation SHOULD aim for a lower secondary education reading level, as recommended by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=315#readable).
* Any code, documentation or tests MAY have a translation.

## Why this is important

* Makes the codebase and what it does understandable for a wider variety of stakeholders in multiple contexts.
* Helps with the discoverability of the codebase.
* Can help you meet the [European Union accessibility directive](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/web-accessibility), which requires most public sector information to be accessible.

## What this does not do

* Make explanations of the codebase's functionality understandable.
* Make your organization's jargon understandable without an explanation.

## How to test

* Check that translations and the English version have the same content.
* Validate that no unexplained acronyms, abbreviations, puns or legal/domain specific terms are in the documentation.
* Test the documentation for grammar using [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/).
* Test the documentation for readability using [Hemingway text editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/).
* Ask someone outside of your context if they understand the content (for example, a developer working on a different codebase).

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Frequently test with other management, developers and designers in the process if they understand what you are delivering and how you document it.

## Management: what you need to do

* Try to limit the use of acronyms, abbreviations, puns or legal/non-English/domain specific terms in internal communications in and between teams and stakeholders. Add any such terms to a glossary and link to it from the places they are being used.
* Be critical of documentation and descriptions in proposals and changes - if you don't understand something, others will probably also struggle with it.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Frequently test with policy makers and management if they understand what you are delivering and how you document it.

## Further reading

* Text of the [Web Content Accessibilty Guidelines 2.1, Guideline 3.1 Readable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#readable) by W3C, make text content readable and understandable.
* [Upgoer 5 text editor](https://splasho.com/upgoer5/) by Theo Sanderson, only allows 1000 most common words.
* [Definition of plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/about/definitions/) by United States General Services Administration.
