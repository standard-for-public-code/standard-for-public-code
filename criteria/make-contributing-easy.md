# Make contributing easy

To develop better, more reliable and feature rich software, users need to be able to fix problems, add features, and address security issues of the shared [codebase](../glossary.md#codebase).

A shared digital infrastructure makes it easier to make collaborative contributions.
The less effort it takes to make contributions that are accepted by the codebase, the more likely users are to become contributors.

## Requirements

* The codebase MUST have a public issue tracker that accepts suggestions from anyone.
* The codebase MUST include instructions for how to privately report security issues for responsible disclosure.
* The documentation MUST link to both the public issue tracker and submitted codebase changes, for example in a `README` file.
* The codebase MUST have communication channels for users and developers, for example email lists.
* The documentation SHOULD include instructions for how to report potentially security sensitive issues on a closed channel.

## What this does not do

* Guarantee others will contribute to the codebase.

## How to test

* Confirm that there is a public issue tracker.
* Confirm that there are instructions for privately reporting security issues.
* Confirm that the codebase contains links to the public issue tracker and submitted codebase changes.
* Confirm that it is possible to participate in a discussion with other users and developers about the software using channels described in the codebase.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Track [policy](../glossary.md#policy) issues in the codebase, so that a relevant external policy expert can volunteer help.

## Managers: what you need to do

* Track management issues in the codebase, so that external managers with relevant experience can volunteer help.
* Support your experienced policy makers, developers and designers to keep contributing to the codebase for as long as possible.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Respond promptly to requests.
* Keep your managers informed of the time and resources you require to support other contributors.
