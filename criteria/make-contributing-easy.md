## Requirements

* The codebase MUST have a public issue tracker that accepts suggestions from anyone.
* The codebase MUST include instructions for how to privately report security issues for responsible disclosure.
* The documentation MUST link to both the public issue tracker and submitted codebase changes, for example in a `README` file.
* The codebase MUST have communication channels for users and developers, for example email lists.
* The documentation SHOULD include instructions for how to report potentially security sensitive issues on a closed channel.

## Why this is important

* Enables users to fix problems and add features to the shared codebase leading to better, more reliable and feature rich software.
* Allows collaborative uptake of shared digital infrastructure.
* Helps users decide to use one codebase over another.

## What this does not do

* Guarantee others will reuse the codebase.

## How to test

* Confirm that there is a public issue tracker.
* Confirm that there are instructions for privately reporting security issues.
* Confirm that the codebase contains links to the public issue tracker and submitted codebase changes.
* Confirm that it is possible to participate in a discussion with other users and developers about the software using channels described in the codebase.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Track policy issues in the codebase, so that a relevant external policy expert can volunteer help.

## Management: what you need to do

* Track management issues in the codebase, so that external managers with relevant experience can volunteer help.
* Support your experienced policy makers, developers and designers to keep contributing to the codebase for as long as possible.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Respond promptly to requests.
* Keep your management informed of the time and resources you require to support other contributors.
