# Archive for the long-term

## Requirements

* You MUST have a copy of your codebase in a long-term archive
* You MUST not rely on your regular development platform as long-term archive,
  unless it *explicitly* provides long-term archival guarantees
* You SHOULD archive both source code itself and all associated development
  artifacts (version control history, issues, discussions, etc.)
* You SHOULD archive your codebase frequently, ideally at every change
* You SHOULD archive on well-known, third party, publicly accessible,
  non-profit archives, that has long-term archival as part of their mission

## Why this is important

Collaborative software development platforms are not archives and generally do
not provide any long-term archival guarantees. They might disappear or change
terms of use in a way that makes retrieving hosted source code (and associated
development artifacts) impossible in the future.

To make sense of a codebase, access to it---both its current version and and
old versions of it that might still be in use somewhere---is fundamental.

In-house long-term archival is an option, as long as it is not performed on the
same platform used for development ("do not put all your eggs in one basket"),
but archival on third-party platforms is preferable, as it reduces the
*organizational risk* (e.g., future changes in available resources, priorities,
etc.) of losing the codebase.

## What this does not do

* Substitute for [version control](version-control-and-history.md)

## How to test

* Try to retrieve a full copy of your codebase, including its development
  history, *without* relying on your usual collaborative development platform
