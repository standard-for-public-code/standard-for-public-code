# Document codebase maturity

Clearly signalling a codebase's maturity helps others decide whether to use and contribute to it.
A codebase version's maturity includes the maturity of its dependencies.
Understanding how a codebase has evolved is key to understanding the codebase and how to contribute to it.

## Requirements

* The [codebase](../glossary.md#codebase) MUST be versioned.
* The codebase MUST prominently document whether or not there are versions of the codebase that are ready to use.
* Codebase versions that are ready to use MUST only depend on versions of other codebases that are also ready to use.
* The codebase SHOULD contain a log of changes from version to version, for example in the `CHANGELOG`.
* The method for assigning version identifiers SHOULD be documented.
* It is OPTIONAL to use semantic versioning.

## What this does not do

* Guarantee that others will use the [code](../glossary.md#code).

## How to test

* Confirm that the codebase has a strategy for versioning which is documented.
* Confirm that it is obvious to policy makers, managers, developers and designers whether the codebase has versions that are ready to use.
* Confirm that ready to use versions of the codebase do not depend on any versions of other codebases that are not ready to use.
* Check that the versioning scheme of the codebase is documented and followed.
* Check that there is a log of changes.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* When developing [policy](../glossary.md#policy), understand that any code developed needs to be tested and improved before it can be put into service.
* Consider versioning policy changes, especially when they trigger new versions of the source code.

## Managers: what you need to do

* Make sure that services only rely on versions of codebases of equal or greater maturity than the service. For example, don't use a beta version of a codebase in a production service.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Ensure that the codebase versioning approach is followed for all releases.
