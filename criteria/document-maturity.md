## Requirements

* A codebase MUST be versioned.
* A codebase that is ready to use MUST only depend on other codebases that are also ready to use.
* A codebase that is not yet ready to use MUST have one of the labels: pre-alpha, alpha, beta or release candidate.
* A codebase SHOULD contain a log of changes from version to version, for example in the `CHANGELOG`.

## Why this is important

Clearly signalling a codebase's maturity helps others decide whether to reuse, invest in or contribute to it.

## What this does not do

* Guarantee that others will use the code.

## How to test

* Confirm that the codebase has a strategy for versioning which is documented.
* Confirm that it is clear where to get the newest version.
* Confirm that the codebase doesn't depend on any codebases marked with a less mature status.
* Confirm that the codebase is ready to use or labeled as prototype, alpha, beta or release candidate version.
* Check that there is a log of changes.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* When developing policy, understand that any code developed needs to be tested and improved before it can be put into service.
* Consider versioning policy changes, especially when they trigger new versions of the source code.

## Management: what you need to do

* Make sure that services only rely on codebases of equal or greater maturity than the service. For example, don't use a beta codebase in a production service or a prototype codebase in a beta service.
* If the codebase is not ready for general use, work with the developers to ensure the codebase is properly labeled:
  * pre-alpha: to test the look and feel, and to internally prove the concept of the technical possibilities,
  * alpha: to do guided tests with a limited set of users,
  * beta: to open up testing to a larger section of the general public, for example to test if the codebase works at scale,
  * release candidate: code that is ready to be released but hasn't received formal approval yet.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Add a prominent header to every interface that indicates the maturity level of the code.
* Version all releases.
* Especially in 'rolling release' scenarios, the version may be automatically derived from the version control system metadata (for example by using [git describe](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-describe)).
