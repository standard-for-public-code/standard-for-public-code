# Document the code

Well documented [source code](../glossary.md#source-code) helps people to understand what the source code does and how to use it.
Documentation is essential for people to start using the [codebase](../glossary.md#codebase).
It also makes contributing to the codebase easier.

## Requirements

* All functionality MUST be described in a clear language. The audience is those that understand the purpose of the codebase.
* The documentation MUST contain a description of how to install and run the software.
* The documentation MUST contain examples demonstrating the key functionality.
* The documentation SHOULD contain an overview that is easy to understand by a wide audience. The audience includes the [general public](../glossary.md#general-public) and journalists.
* The documentation SHOULD contain a section describing how to install and run a standalone version of the software. This includes a test dataset if necessary.
* The documentation SHOULD contain examples for all functionality.
* The documentation SHOULD describe the key components or modules and their relationships. For example, this could be done as a high level architectural diagram.
* There SHOULD be [continuous integration](../glossary.md#continuous-integration) tests for the quality of the documentation.

## How to test

* Confirm that other stakeholders find the documentation clear and understandable. Stakeholders should include professionals from other public organizations and the general public.
* Confirm that the documentation describes how to install and run the source code.
* Confirm that the documentation includes examples of the key functionality.
* Check with members of the general public and journalists if they can understand the overview.
* Check that the instructions for how to install and run a standalone version of the source code result in a running system.
* Check that all functionality documented contains an example.
* Check that the documentation includes a high level architectural diagram or similar.
* Check that documentation quality is part of integration testing. For example, test that documentation is generated correctly, and test links and images.

## Public policy makers: what you need to do

* Check in regularly to understand how the non-policy code in the codebase has changed.
* Give feedback on how to make non-policy documentation more clear.

## Managers: what you need to do

* Try to use the codebase so that you can provide feedback. This can improve how the [policy](../glossary.md#policy) and source code are documented. For example, is the documentation good enough to persuade a manager at another public organization to use this codebase?
* Make sure you understand both the policy and source code as well as the documentation.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Check in regularly to understand how the non-source code in the codebase has changed.
* Give feedback on how to make non-source documentation more clear.
