# Foster an active community

## Requirements

* Software MUST be in use by multiple parties
* Communication channels MUST exist for users AND developers
* The roadmap SHOULD be influenced by the needs of multiple parties
* MAY hold regular events

## Why this is important

* Members of active communities support each other.
* Codebases without communities are either too narrow for stewardship by the Foundation for Public code or must continue under incubation until a self-sustaining community can be built.

## What this does not do

* This does not shift responsibility for documentation, support, bug-fixing, or anything else to an unpaid community.

## How to test

* Count known users
* Count messages per week
* Count commits per week
* Count distinct commit authors per week
* Graph bug time-to-resolution over time
* Count bugs and feature requests opened over time

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Policy makers should ensure that their organization is listed in the known users.

## Management: what you need to do

* Ensure awareness of the community
* Track and publish metrics

## Developers and designers: what you need to do
* Track and publish code metrics
