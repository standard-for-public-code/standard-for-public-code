# Document your code

## Requirements

* All of the functionality of your codebase – policy as well as source – MUST be described in language clearly understandable for those that understand the purpose of the code
* The documentation of your codebase MUST contain the following:
  * a description of how to install and run the source code
  * a selection of examples, demonstrating the key functionality
* The documentation of your codebase SHOULD contain the following:
  * a high level description that is clearly understandable for a wide audience of stakeholders such as the general public and journalists
  * a section describing how to install and run a standalone version of the source code, including, if necessary, a test dataset
  * examples for all functionality
* There SHOULD be continuous integration tests for the quality of your documentation
* The documentation of your codebase MAY contain the following:
  * examples that make users want to immediately start using your codebase!
* You MAY use the examples in your documentation to test your code

## Why this is important

* Users can start using and contributing more quickly
* You help people discover your codebase, especially people asking 'is there already code that does something like this'
* Provide transparency into your organization and processes

## What this does not do

* Contribute directly to more reusable, portable code (see Coding in the open)

## How to test

* Other stakeholders, professionals from other public organizations and the general public find the documentation clear and understandable
* Documentation is generated from code
* Links and images are automatically tested

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Try to periodically understand what the non-policy code in the codebase does
* Give feedback on how to make non-policy documentation more clear

## Management: what you need to do

* Try to use the codebase
* Make sure you understand both the policy and source as well as its documentation

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Try to periodically understand what the non-source code in the codebase does
