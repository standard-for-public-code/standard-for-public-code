# Document the code

## Requirements

* All of the functionality of the codebase – policy as well as source – MUST be described in language clearly understandable for those that understand the purpose of the code.
* The documentation of the codebase MUST contain:
  * a description of how to install and run the source code,
  * examples demonstrating the key functionality.
* The documentation of the codebase SHOULD contain:
  * a high level description that is clearly understandable for a wide audience of stakeholders, like the general public and journalists,
  * a section describing how to install and run a standalone version of the source code, including, if necessary, a test dataset,
  * examples for all functionality.
* There SHOULD be continuous integration tests for the quality of your documentation.
* The documentation of the codebase MAY contain examples that make users want to immediately start using the codebase.
* You MAY use the examples in your documentation to test the code.

## Why this is important

* Users can start using and contributing more quickly.
* You help people discover the codebase, especially people asking 'is there already code that does something like this'.
* This provides transparency into your organization and processes.

## What this does not do

* Contribute directly to more reusable, portable code (see [Code in the open](./code-in-the-open.md)).

## How to test

* Other stakeholders, professionals from other public organizations and the general public find the documentation clear and understandable.
* Documentation is generated from code.
* Links and images are automatically tested.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Check in regularly to understand how the non-policy code in the codebase has changed.
* Give feedback on how to make non-policy documentation more clear.

## Management: what you need to do

* Try to use the codebase.
* Make sure you understand both the policy and source code as well as the documentation.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Check in regularly to understand how the non-source code in the codebase has changed.
* Give feedback on how to make non-source documentation more clear.
