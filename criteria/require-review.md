# Require review of contributions

## Requirements

* All contributions that are accepted or committed to release versions of the codebase MUST be reviewed by another contributor
* Review MUST include source, policy, tests and documentation
* Reviewers MUST provide feedback on all decisions made and the implementation in the review
* Contributions SHOULD conform to the standards, architecture and decisions set out in the codebase in order to pass review
* Review SHOULD include executing running both the code and the tests of the codebase
* Contributions SHOULD be reviewed by someone in a different context than the contributor
* Version control systems SHOULD not accept non-reviewed contributions in release versions
* Reviews SHOULD happen within two business days
* Reviews MAY be performed by multiple reviewers

## Why this is important

* Increases codebase quality
* Reduces security as well as operational risks
* Creates a culture of making every contribution great
* Catches the most obvious mistakes that could happen
* Gives contributors the security that their contributions are only accepted if they really add value and provide a guaranteed point for feedback or collaborative improvement

## What this does not do

* Guarantee the right solution to a problem
* Mean that reviewers are liable
* Absolve a contributor from writing documentation and tests
* Provide you with the right reviewers

## How to test

* Every commit in the history has been reviewed by a different contributor in a different context

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Institute a 'four eyes' policy where everything, not just code, should be reviewed
* Use a version control system or methodology that enables review and feedback

## Management: what you need to do

* Make delivering great code a shared objective
* Make sure writing and reviewing contributions to source, policy, documentation and tests are considered equally valuable
* Create a culture where all contributions are welcome and everyone is empowered to review them
* Make sure no contributor is ever alone in contributing to a project

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Find other contributors on the project you would like to review your work, in your organization or outside of it
* Look often at the listings of requests for code review and try to review others' contributions as much as possible
