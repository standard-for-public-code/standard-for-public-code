# Use a coherent style

## Requirements

* Contributions MUST adhere to a coding and/or writing style guide, either your own or an existing one that is advertised in or a part of the codebase
* Contributions SHOULD pass automated tests on style
* Your codebase SHOULD include inline comments and documentation for non-trivial sections
* You MAY include sections in your style guide on understandable english

## Why this is important

* Enables contributors in different environments to work together on a unified product
* Unify vocabularies removing friction from communication between contributors

## What this does not do

* Help contributors write well or explain what they do well

## How to test

* Inspect wether the contributions are in line with the style guides as they are set out in the documentation

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Create, follow and continually improve on a style guide for policy and documentation as well as document this in the codebase, for example in the `CONTRIBUTING` or `README`

## Management: what you need to do

* Include written language, source, test and policy standards in your organizational definition of quality

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Create, follow and continually improve on a style guide for source, tests  and documentation as well as document this in the codebase, for example in the `CONTRIBUTING` or `README`
* Use a linter
* Add linter configurations to the codebase
