# Publish with an open license

An open and well known license makes it possible for anyone to see the code in order to understand how it works, to use it freely and to contribute to the codebase.

Clearly indicating the license for each file within a codebase facilitates correct reuse and attribution of parts of a codebase.

## Requirements

* All [code](../glossary.md#code) and documentation MUST be licensed such that it may be freely reusable, changeable and redistributable.
* Software source code MUST be licensed under an [OSI-approved or FSF Free/Libre license](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
* All code MUST be published with a license file.
* Contributors MUST NOT be required to transfer copyright of their contributions to the [codebase](../glossary.md#codebase).
* All source code files in the codebase SHOULD include a copyright notice and a license header that are machine-readable.
* Having multiple licenses for different types of code and documentation is OPTIONAL.

## What this does not do

* Prevent use of the code by any specific actors.

## How to test

* Confirm that the codebase is clearly licensed.
* Confirm that the license for the source code is on the [OSI-approved or FSF Free/Libre license list](https://spdx.org/licenses/) and the license for documentation [conforms to the Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/licenses/).
* Confirm that the licenses used in the codebase are included as files.
* Confirm that contribution guidelines and [repository](../glossary.md#repository) configuration do not require transfer of copyright.
* Check for machine-readable license checking in the codebase [continuous integration](../glossary.md#continuous-integration) tests.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Develop [policy](../glossary.md#policy) that requires code to be [open source](../glossary.md#open-source).
* Develop policy that disincentivizes non-open source code and technology in procurement.

## Managers: what you need to do

* Only work with open source vendors that deliver their code by publishing it under an open source license.
* Beware that even though [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) are great for documentation, licenses that stipulate Non-Commercial or No Derivatives are NOT freely reusable, changeable and redistributable and don't fulfill these requirements.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Add a new `license` file to every new codebase created.
* Add a copyright notice and a license header to every new source code file created.
