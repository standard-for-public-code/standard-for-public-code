# Publish with an open licence

## Requirements

* All code and documentation MUST be published under a licence that allows it to be freely reusable, changeable and redistributable
* Software source code this MUST be licensed under an [OSI-approved open source licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/category)
* All code MUST be published with a licence
* Codebases MAY have multiple licences for different types of code and documentation
* Documentation MAY be published under [Creative Commons licences
](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) that are NOT 'no derivatives' or 'non-commercial'

## Why this is important

* Makes it possible for anyone to see the code and know that they can and how they can reuse it

## What this does not do

* Prevent use of the code by any specific actors

## How to test

* There is at least 1 licence file present in the codebase, usually called `LICENCE`
* If there is source code in the codebase there is a licence present that is on the [OSI-approved Open Source licence list](https://opensource.org/licenses/category)

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Develop policy that requires code to be open source
* Develop policy that disincentives non-open source code and technology in procurement

## Management: what you need to do

* Only work with open source vendors that deliver their code by publishing it under an open source licence

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Add a new `LICENCE` file to every new codebase created
