## Requirements

* All source code for any policy and software in use (unless used for fraud detection) MUST be published and publicly accessible.
* Contributors MUST NOT upload sensitive information regarding users, their organization or third parties to the repository.
* Any source code not currently in use (such as new versions, proposals or older versions) SHOULD be published.
* The codebase MAY provide the general public with insight into which source code or policy underpins any specific interaction they have with an organization.

## Why this is important

Coding in the open:

* improves transparency
* increases code quality
* facilitates the auditing processes

These aspects together create more opportunities for citizens to understand how software and policy impact their interactions with a public organization.

## What this does not do

* Make source code or policy reusable.
* Make the codebase and the code within it understandable to as many people as possible.

## How to test

The source for any version currently in use is published on the internet where it can be seen:

* from outside the original contributing organization
* without the need for any form of authentication or authorization

Review the codebase files and commit history to verify no sensitive information is included.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Develop policies in the open.
* Prioritize open and transparent policies.

## Management: what you need to do

* Develop a culture that embraces openness, learning and feedback.
* Collaborate with external vendors and freelancers by working in the open.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* As a reviewer, for each commit, verify that content does not include sensitive information such as configurations, usernames or passwords, public keys or other real credentials used in production systems.
* Clearly split data and code, in order to meet the requirement about sensitive information above.
