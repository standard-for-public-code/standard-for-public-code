## Request for contributions

We believe public policy and software should be inclusive, usable, open, legible, accountable, accessible and sustainable. This means we need a new way of designing, developing and procuring both the source code and policy documentation.

This standard sets a quality level for codebases that meets the needs of public organizations, institutions and administrations as well as other critical infrastructural services.

The standard lives at [standard.publiccode.net](https://standard.publiccode.net/). See [`index.md`](index.md) for an overview of all content.
