# Standard for Public Code

![version 0.1.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.1-red.svg)

Request for contributions

We believe public policy and software should be inclusive, usable, open, legible, accountable, accessible and sustainable. This means we need a new way of designing, developing and procuring both the source code and policy documentation.

This standard sets a quality level for codebases that meets the needs of public organizations, institutions and administrations as well as other critical infrastructural services.

The standard lives at [standard.publiccode.net](https://standard.publiccode.net/), and for an overview of all content see [`index.md`](index.md).
