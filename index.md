Welcome to the Standard for Public Code.

We define ‘public code’ as open source software developed by public organizations (like cities), together with the policy and guidance needed for reuse.

The Standard for Public Code gives cities a model for building their own open source solutions to enable successful future reuse by other cities. It includes guidance for policymakers, city administrators, developers and vendors.

The [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net/) will help cities share and adopt open source software, build sustainable developer communities and create a thriving ecosystem for public code. This allows cities to save money on procurement, development and maintenance, and supports their technological sovereignty.
