# Welcome to the Standard for Public Code

The Standard for Public Code is a set of criteria that supports public organizations in developing and maintaining software and policy together.

The Standard for Public Code gives public organizations a model for building their own open source solutions to enable successful future collaboration and reuse by similar organizations in the public sector in other places.
It includes guidance for policy makers, government administrators, developers and vendors.
The Standard for Public Code supports the collaborative creation of codebases that are usable, open, legible, accountable, accessible and sustainable.
It is meant to be applicable to codebases for all levels of government, from supranational to municipal.

We define ‘public code’ as open source software developed by public organizations, together with the policy and guidance needed for collaboration and reuse.

The criteria of the Standard for Public Code are aligned with guidelines and best practices of open source software development.

There are also unofficial [community translations of the Standard](https://publiccodenet.github.io/community-translations-standard/) in other languages.
