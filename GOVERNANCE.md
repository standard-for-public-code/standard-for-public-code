# Governance

This standard lies at the core of the codebase stewardship that our organization provides. It is the document on the basis of which we decide that a codebase is ready for community co-development.

The standard is maintained by the staff of our organization.

[We welcome contributions – such as suggestions for changes or general feedback – from anyone.](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Because of the important role that the Standard for Public Code has in our core process we require the highest standards from the standard.

We will try to respond promptly to all pull requests. The pull request is an opportunity to work together to improve our methods and the Standard. We may not accept all changes, but we will explain our logic.
