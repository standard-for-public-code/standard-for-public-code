This standard lies at the core of the codebase stewardship provided by the [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net/).
We decide if a codebase is ready for community co-development based on this document.

The standard is maintained by Foundation for Public Code staff.

[We welcome contributions, such as suggestions for changes or general feedback, from anyone.](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Because of the important role that the Standard for Public Code has in our core process we require the highest standards from the Standard.

We will try to respond promptly to all pull requests.
The pull request is an opportunity to work together to improve our methods and the Standard.
We may not accept all changes, but we will explain our logic.
