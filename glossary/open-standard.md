# Open standard

Open Standard is used as to describe any standard the meets the requirements as defined by the Open Source Initiative in their [Open Standard Requirements](https://opensource.org/osr).

> ## The Requirement
>
> An "open standard" must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software.
> 
> ## The Criteria
> 
> To comply with the Open Standards Requirement, an "open standard" must satisfy the following criteria. If an "open standard" does not meet these criteria, it will be discriminating against open source developers.
> 
> 1. No Intentional Secrets: The standard MUST NOT withhold any detail necessary for interoperable implementation. As flaws are inevitable, the standard MUST define a process for fixing flaws identified during implementation and interoperability testing and to incorporate said changes into a revised version or superseding version of the standard to be released under terms that do not violate the OSR.
> 
> 2. Availability: The standard MUST be freely and publicly available (e.g., from a stable web site) under royalty-free terms at reasonable and non-discriminatory cost.
> 
> 3. Patents: All patents essential to implementation of the standard MUST:
>     1. be licensed under royalty-free terms for unrestricted use, or
>     2. be covered by a promise of non-assertion when practiced by open source software 
> 
> 4.  No Agreements: There MUST NOT be any requirement for execution of a license agreement, NDA, grant, click-through, or any other form of paperwork to deploy conforming implementations of the standard.
> 5. No OSR-Incompatible Dependencies: Implementation of the standard MUST NOT require any other technology that fails to meet the criteria of this Requirement.
